* =pytest_container=: Testing containers with python and pytest

This repository contains the slides for a presentation introducing [[https://github.com/dcermak/pytest_container][pytest_container]].

You can find the rendered slides here: [[https://dcermak.github.io/pytest_container-presentation/pytest_container.html][dcermak.github.io/pytest_container-presentation]].


** Building the slides

You can create the html slides yourself from within Emacs by opening the
[[./pytest_container.org]] file, launching =org-mode= and executing ~(require
'ox-reveal)~ (you might have to install =ox-reveal= beforehand). Then export the
org file to reveal.js (this is by default bound to the keychord =C-c C-e R R=).

If you are not a Emacs user, then just install Emacs and execute:
#+begin_src bash
emacs pytest_container.org -Q --batch -l export-init.el -f org-reveal-export-to-html --kill
#+end_src
